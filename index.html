            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                I always enjoyed studying and creating things that involved computers. But that's just one thing about
                me.
                I love spending time with my girlfriend, my friends, my cats, playing games, watching movies, etc.
                I do like studying low level programming also, like C language, x86 architecture and NASM asembler.
            </p>
            <p>I plan on creating a blog website for posting about my projects and things I like talking about, but that's just an idea for now.</p>
